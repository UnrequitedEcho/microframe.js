# microframe.js

microframe.js is a **small**, **lightweight** and **dependency-free** lightbox and full-screen gallery effect for images, videos, and custom HTML content, written in **vanilla JavaScript**. It weighs in at around 2.5kB when gzipped (js + CSS), and the script itself is a single, self-contained file of roughly 300 lines of clean, object-oriented code, released under the MIT License.

It has been tested across several desktop and mobile browsers, but it is not yet battle-tested and intentionally avoids the heavy defensive programming that would make it bullet-proof. In exchange, it is significantly easier to read and extend. Compared to [GLightbox](https://biati-digital.github.io/glightbox/) or [Lightbox2](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/), microframe.js aims for a middle ground between the customizability and the completeness of features of the former and the ease of use of the latter.
